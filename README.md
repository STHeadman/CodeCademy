Codecademy Projects
===================

These are files used for projects used in codecademy
----------------------------------------------------

Most of the work here is the "after each lesson project"  They are the fruit of what I learned in the the lesson.


Also there is a cheat sheet that I have been working on for reference. It will include:  HTML, CSS, and JAVA syntax.

You can view my portfolio cheat sheet website here: [Web Development Reference Site](https://stheadman.github.io/CodeCademy/ "Cheat Sheet website")
